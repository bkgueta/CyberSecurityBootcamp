#### Server Side Attacks

In today’s globally connected cyber community, network and OS level attacks are well defended through the proper deployment of technical security controls such as, firewalls, IDS, Data Loss Prevention, EndPoint and security. However, web servers are accessible from anywhere on the web, making them vulnerable to attack.

1. What is the process called that cleans and scrubs user input in order to prevent it from exploiting security holes by proactively modifying user input.

Answer:

2. Name the process that tests user and application-supplied input. The process is designed to prevent malformed data from entering a data information system by verifying user input meets a specific set of criteria (i.e. a string that does not contain standalone single quotation marks).

Answer:

3. **Secure SDLC** is the process of ensuring security is built into web applications throughout the entire software development life cycle. Name three reasons why organization might fail at producing secure web applications.

Answer:

4. How might an attacker exploit the `robots.txt` file on a web server?

Answer:

5. What steps can an organization take to obscure or obfuscate their contact information on domain registry web sites?

Answer:
   
6. True or False: As a network defender, `Client-Side` validation is preferred over `Server-Side` validation because it's easier to defend against attacks.

   - Explain why you chose the answer that you did.

Answer:

____

#### Web Application Firewalls

WAFs are designed to defend against different types of HTTP attacks and various query types such as SQLi and XSS.

WAFs are typically present on web sites that use strict transport security mechanisms such as online banking or e-commerce websites.

1. Which layer of the OSI model do WAFs operate at?

Answer:

2. A WAF helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring what?

Answer:

3. True or False: A WAF based on the negative security model (Blacklisting) protects against known attacks, and a WAF based on the positive security model (Whitelisting) allows pre-approved traffic to pass.

Answer:
____

#### Authentication and Access Controls

Security enhancements designed to require users to present two or more pieces of evidence or credentials when logging into an account is called multi-factor authentication.

- Legislation and regulations such as The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard requires the use of MFAs for all network access to a Card Data Environment (CDE).

- Security administrators should have a comprehensive understanding of the basic underlying principles of how MFA works.

1. Define all four factors of multifactor authentication and give examples of each:

   - Factor 1:

   
   - Factor 2:
   
   
   - Factor 3:

   
   - Factor 4:

   
2. True or False: A password and pin is an example of 2-factor authentication.

Answer:
   
3. True or False: A password and `google authenticator app` is an example of 2-factor authentication.

Answer:
   
4. What is a constrained user interface?

### Part 2: The Challenge 

In this activity, you will assume the role of a pen tester hired by a bank to test the security of the bank’s authentication scheme, sensitive financial data, and website interface.


#### Lab Environment   

We'll use the **Web Vulns** lab environment. To access it: 
  - Log in to the Azure Classroom Labs dashboard. 
  - Find the card with the title **Web Vulns** or **Web Vulnerability and Hardening**.
  - Click the monitor icon in the bottom-right. 
  - Select **Connect with RDP**.
  - Use Credentials (azadmin:p4ssw0rd*)

- The lab should already be started, so you should be able to connect immediately. 

- Refer to the [lab setup instructions](https://cyberxsecurity.gitlab.io/documentation/using-classroom-labs/post/2019-01-09-first-access/) for details on setting up the RDP connection.

Once the lab environment is running, open the HyperV manager and make sure that the OWASPBWA and Kali box is running.

- Then, login to the Kali VM and navigate to the IP address of the OWASPBWA machine.

- Click the option for 'WebGoat' and start the WebGoat app.

- Use the credentials: `guest`:`guest`

On the bottom of the left side of the screen, click on `Challenge` and then choose `The Challenge`.

**Note:** A common issue with this lab is the Challange activity failing to start successfully. Hit the `Restart the Lesson` button in the top right if you get an error starting the activity.

### The Challenge Instructions

#### Challenge #1

Your first mission is to break the authentication scheme. There are a number of ways to accomplish this task.

- **Hint #1**: Sometimes, form fields are shy!

- **Hint #2**: Find the hidden JavaScript.

- **Hint #3**: You can appened `source?source=true` to the URL to read the source code. 

Please include a screenshot here of the hidden JavaScript:

After completing the first challenge, you will be provided with an option to continue to the next challenge.

#### Challenge #2

Next, steal all of the credit card numbers from the database. 

- **Hint #1**: Sometimes cookies wear different clothes to change their appearances.

- **Hint #2**: Break your way into the conversation and inject your own ideas.

Please include a screenshot here of all the credit card numbers from the database. 

After completing the second challenge, you will be provided with an option to continue to the next challenge.


#### Challenge #3

Your final act is to deface the website using command injection. Follow the walkthrough below to help you get started. 

- After completing the second challenge, you will be provided with an option to continue to the next challenge.

   ![cracked credit cards](Images/credit_cards-cracked.png)

- There should be two webpages at the bottom of the window. The one on top is the original, and the one on the bottom is the defaced webpage.

   ![original webpage](Images/original_defaced.png)

- Start Foxy Proxy (WebScarab) to send all GET/POST requests from Firefox to the WebScarab proxy intercept.

   ![Foxy Proxy](Images/foxy_proxy_scab.png)

- Click **TCP** and then the **View Network** button and send the request to WebScarab.

   ![View Network](Images/view_network_tcp.png)

- The WebScarab window will open. 

   - In the **URL Encoded** tab, find the **File** and **Value** form fields. 
   - This is where you will perform your command injection.
   
    ![File Field](Images/webscarab_file_value_field.png)

- Next, perform a test and see if this shell is vulnerable to command injection. 

   - Type the following command into the Value field: `tcp && whoami && pwd`.
   
       - **Note:** Windows users can type `tcp && dir`. `dir` will return the directory as proof of vulnerability.
   
   - Click **Accept Changes**.
   
     ![whoami](Images/whoami_pwd_image.png)
   
   - On the next window, click **Accept Changes** twice.
   
     ![accept](Images/webscarab_2nd_window.png)
 
- Scroll to the bottom of the **Current Network Status** window and observe the results for both of the `whoami` and `pwd` commands.

    ![whoami & pwd](Images/whoami_pwd.png)

   - The results show that we are the root user and our current working directory is `/var/lib/tomcat6`.

   - This verifies the vulnerability, so proceed to the next step.

- Next, we'll locate the `webgoat_challenge_guest.jsp` file. 

   - Type the following command: `tcp && cd / && find . -iname webgoat_challenge_guest.jsp`.
   
      - **Note**: Windows users will need to type: `tcp && dir /s 'webgoat_challenge_guest.jsp'`
   
   ![find command](Images/webscarab_find_command.png)
   
   - The absolute path is: `./owaspbwa/owaspbwa-svn/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/WebGoat/webgoat_challenge_guest.jsp`.
   
   ![absolute path](Images/webscarab_abolute_path.png)
   
   - Remember, our present working directory is `/var/lib/tomcat6`. Therefore, the relative path is `webapps/WebGoat/webgoat_challenge_guest.jsp`.
   
**Now it's your turn**   

- Now that we know where the webpage is, your task will be to deface the website. Keep in mind the following:
  * Use **WebScarab** to perform command injection.
  * When performing command injection, you will need to select a field that WebScarab can return commands to. These fields are typically located in a drop down. 
  * You will also need to locate and edit the the webpage's source code: `webgoat_challenge_guest.jsp`
  * Your final command will:
    * Change to the location of the `webgoat_challenge_guest.jsp` file.
    * **and** echo `You've been hacked by...` followed by your name, to the `webgoat_challenge_guest.jsp` file.
    
Please include a screenshot of the defaced website.
