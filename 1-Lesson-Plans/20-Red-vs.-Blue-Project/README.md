## Unit  README: 

### Unit Description

In the second project week, you will work on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which you will play the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.

As the Red Team, you will attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, you will use Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. You'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.

Then, you will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that you've successfully performed.


### Unit Objectives

In this unit, you will be using the Web Vulns lab environment located in Windows Azure Lab Services. RDP into the Windows RDP host machine using the following credentials:

Username: `azadmin`
Password: `p4ssw0rd*`

Open the Hyper-V Manager to access the nested machines:

- ELK machine credentials:

    - Username: vagrant
    - Password: vagrant

**Next Week's Lab Environment**: At the end of 20.3, we will set up a new Azure Lab Environment for the Forensics unit.

### What to Be Aware Of:

- Day 1 can be completed as a competition between the students. If you wish to do so, split the students into teams and have them compete to win a prize! The first team to complete _all_ the steps wins.

- Let students know that to complete Day 2 they must complete steps 1-6 from Day 1. Finding the flag isn't critical, but students need to progress past the point of uploading the reverse shell script.

- Throughout Day 2, it is important that the students take screen shots of each step they complete. These screen shots will be used in their Day 3 Report.

### Security+ Domains
