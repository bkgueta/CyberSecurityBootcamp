## Unit 1 README: Security 101

### Unit Description LM

Welcome! This document is a weekly unit README. It provides an overview of the unit, along with technical lab information, useful resources, and links to homework assignments. 

- In this unit, we will become familiar with the structure of the course and learn about some of the tools and topics that this course will cover. We will cover fundamental cybersecurity concepts, like the CIA triad, and work in groups to assess attack and defense strategies of vulnerable data. 

- We will also install and set up the virtual machine environment that we will use throughout the course. 

- On the final day of this unit, we will focus on professional pathways by studying cybersecurity certifications, domains, and professions.

### What to Be Aware Of

- Throughout the course, we will use features on Zoom and Slack to optimize the online learning experience. These tools include breakout rooms for group activities and class polls to assess comprehension after activities. 

- On Day 2, we will set up the virtual lab environments that we will use throughout the boot camp. In preparation for this setup, you should download VirtualBox and Vagrant onto your personal machine. Additionally, Windows users should download Git Bash. The prework provides instructions for this setup, and you will receive assistance in class if you have any issues. 

- On Day 3, we will cover cybersecurity professional pathways and certifications. It is perfectly okay if you do not have a strong sense of the specific pathways you would like to pursue at this time. Over the next 24 weeks, this boot camp will present a wide scope of cybersecurity skills and domains, giving you the opportunity to narrow down what interests and motivates you.


### Security+ Domains

On Day 3 of this unit, we will introduce the Security+ exam and its domains. In the coming units, we will provide details about other domains covered on the exam. 

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource:

### Looking Forward 

The next unit will cover governance, risk, and compliance—three fundamental concepts security teams use to instill strong security controls and a healthy security culture within organizations. 

We will examine how a security team interacts with the larger business organization, and identify and prioritize attacks and vulnerabilities through risk management and threat modeling frameworks. We will also learn about various regulations and laws that inform the policies that security teams enforce.
